# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose
With an aging Pewlett Hackard work force Bobby was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help to lessen the impact of the impending "silver tsunami."

## Results

### Takeaways
Our analysis provided four main points.
 - Senior Engineers are the largest population of retiring individuals
 - Engineering as a whole will be hard hit by the "silver tsunami"
 - We seem to have a good amount of mentors available, but they will each have to mentor several junior employees and even then we may not have enough
 - Of the approximately 300,000 employees that have ever worked for Pewlett Hackard, approximately 90,000 are part of this "silver tsunami"

## Summary
With such a large amount of employees retiring around the same time, Pewlett Hackard will have to start preparing now to lessen the impact.

### Additional Information
In addition to the information we gathered, we also want to know the number of mentors by title that Pewlett Hackard has.

This image shows that we do have a fair number of potential mentors, but with the number of pending retirees, we will struggle to accomodate such a large shift in the workforce.

From our earlier analysis we see that there are approximately 90,000 roles that will need to be filled. Of these 90K jobs, approximately half are in Engineering, which is an area that we will want to invest heavily in in preparation of this "silver tsunami."
